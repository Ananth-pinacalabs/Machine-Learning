<p align = "center">Branch of math to Collect, Analyse,  interpret and present data. Tools and methods to make sense of a large amounts of data and make decisions based on them. </p>



| Descriptive Ststistics    | Inferential Statistics|
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Collection organisation, ananlysis and presentation of data | Making predictions and conclusions about a population from a sample.|
| calculate parameters of data , to `summarzie` and `describe`  to best describe it without making inferences| Use probability theory to  estimate the likelihood of certain events occuring, and determine  if some claim is valid with the help of data and exmine the relationship among.|


<h2><b>Population vs sample</b></h2>

#### **Population** -
 The entire group of individuals that we are interested in studying. This is the complete set of observations that we want to make inferences about. 

ex - All the students in a school , all the cars in a country. 

#### **Sample**
A subset of the population that we use to make inferences/ estimate characteristics of the population.

**Things of importance when it comes to sampling** - 
1. Sample size
2. Randomness
3. Representaiveness

**Parameter vs Statistics** - 
* A `parameter` is a characteristic of a `population`, (usually unknown, -  Estimated using inferential statistics). 
* A `statistic` is a characteristic of a `sample`.(Calculated).

<h2 align = "center">Quick Glimpse Into Inferential Statistics</h2>

Making inferences about a larger population using a sample of data. Involves statistical techniquues to test hypothesis and draw conclusions from data.


* **Hypothesis Testing** - testing a hypothesis about a population parameter based on sample data. Mean height of a population os different froma  given value.

* **Confidence Interval** - Estimate the range of a population parameter from sample data.

* **ANOVA (Ananlysis of Varience)**  - To compare the means across multiple groups to see if there is a significant difference. Ex - Mean heigt of people from different regions. 

* **Regression Analysis**  - To test the relationship  between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 

* **Chi Squared tests** - The independece or association between two categorical variables, ex if gender and occupations are two independent variables. 

* **Bayesian Statistics** - Involves updating the beliefs  about the probability  of an event based on new evidence.

* **Sampling technique** - Techniques to pick a `representative`  smple from the population.
